Welcome to my professional profile where I showcase my work, skills,
and achievements. I will be sharing my academics and growing experience 
in my career. As a biology major, my purpose is to explore the systems
of life and engage in research, observation, and critical thinking.
I am interested in the focus of medical science and human biology.
My academic journey has equipped me with skills in data analysis, 
laboratory techniques, and foundational principles of science. 
My goal is to continually learn to further my education and contribute
to meaningful work and research in the medical field. This website will 
serve as a basis of all my achievements, skills, experiences, and aspirations.
Each of which are a step in the direction of my future endeavor of
making a change in the world through the service of helping others.
