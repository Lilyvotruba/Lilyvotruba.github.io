      <p>
        Hello, my name is Lily Votruba. I am currently a second-year student at the University of Missouri pursuing
        a degree in Biological Sciences with an emphasis in Medical Science and Human Biology. I recently obtained my
        certification as a Nursing Assistant (CNA), working to gain hands-on experience through patient care to further
        my career. My long-term goal is to attend Certified Anesthesiologist Assistant school after graduation to
        provide patients with direct anesthesia care during medical and surgical procedures, ensuring patient safety
        and pain management. Outside of the classroom I am involved in a Greek-letter organization. This pushes me to
        stay engaged with my campus community as well as provide me with resources to enhance my leadership skills.
        I also enjoy spending time outside through long walks while listening to music. I am very passionate about my
        goals, and I look forward to making a meaningful impact in my future field.
      </p>
