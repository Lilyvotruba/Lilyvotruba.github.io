 <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h3>Educational overview:</h3>
   <h4> Graduated from Timberland High School in 2024 </h4>
 <h5> Currently attending the University of Missouri on track to graduate May 2028</h5>
 <p>
  Hello, my name is Lily Votruba. I am currently a second-year student at the University of Missouri pursuing
  a degree in Biological Sciences with an emphasis in Medical Science and Human Biology. I recently obtained my
  certification as a Nursing Assistant (CNA), working to gain hands-on experience through patient care to further
  my career. My long-term goal is to attend Certified Anesthesiologist Assistant school after graduation to 
  provide patients with direct anesthesia care during medical and surgical procedures, ensuring patient safety 
  and pain management. Outside of the classroom I am involved in a Greek-letter organization. This pushes me to 
  stay engaged with my campus community as well as provide me with resources to enhance my leadership skills. 
  I also enjoy spending time outside through long walks while listening to
  music. I am very passionate about my goals, and I look forward to making a meaningful impact in my future field.
