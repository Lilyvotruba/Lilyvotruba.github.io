 <h1>Personal Reflection</h1>
 <h2>Path to My Profession</h2>
 <p>From a young age, I have always loved to nurture those who surrounded me. Whether it was through helping friends and 
  family or taking care of family pets, I found a purpose in caring for others. This has guided me to make many of my life 
  decisions, including choosing my career path. 
  As I was getting older and deciding where to go to college and what to study, I found a fascination in medicine. 
  I was intrigued at how it can be used to heal people and improve their quality of life. I knew that I wanted to work in a 
  field where I could make a difference, and the medical field provides endless opportunities to achieve that.
My first job started at the ice cream shop up the street, Coldstone Creamery. I was freshly 16 and eager to take on a new 
  responsibility. This new role taught me many valuable skills I encompass today. I learned how to work alongside others as a 
  team, communication with customers, and how to handle a fast-paced environment. I was able to grow my social skills as well
  as strong work-ethic early on. I carried this with me into my next journey at Vegas Tan. Working as a Tanning Specialist gave 
  me a new wave of responsibility. I oversaw tasks such as determining an appropriate tanning time for customers based on
  their skin type and customizing spray tan colors based on desires. I was able to gain more confidence in assessing
  situations and providing guidance to customers. I found a love for this job through the act of service to customers, 
  helping them achieve their most desired state.
Going away to my first year of college I had decided on a major in Biology with an emphasis in Medical Science and Human 
  Biology. In the spring semester I enrolled in a summer course to complete my Certification as a Nursing Assistant (CNA).
  Through this program I completed 75 classroom hours as well as 100 clinical hours working directly with residents. I was 
  able to solidify my aspiration of helping others. Working first-hand with residents I developed a deeper understanding of
  patient care through assistance of daily activities. I learned how to assist in feeding, transferring, bathing and most
  importantly patient dignity. This experience was very challenging but incredibly rewarding in return. I gained real 
  experience in the physical and emotional parts of healthcare, something that couldn’t be taught in a classroom.
From each of my unique experiences I have landed on one major career goal: to make a change. Each step I have taken to 
  get here has shaped me to understand the value of responsibility, communication, and empathy. I now have settled on 
  pursuing a career as an Anesthesiologist Assistant. As I finish my final three years of undergraduate I plan to 
  continue to gain experience through work as a caregiver. This will provide me with more exposure in understanding
  patient care and a healthcare setting. I am very excited to continue learning and growing as a person, and pursuing
  this journey where I can make a difference in people’s lives.</p>
